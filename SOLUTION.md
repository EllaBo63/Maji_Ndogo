# Maji Ndogo Water Project
The Maji Ndogo Water Project is a large-scale initiative aimed at enhancing water accessibility and quality for millions of residents across multiple provinces. 
This repository contains project data, visualizations, and analyses detailing the outcomes, budget allocation, population served, and improvements by region.

## Project Overview
The primary objective of the Maji Ndogo Water Project was to improve water access for underserved communities by implementing public taps, RO (Reverse Osmosis) and UV filters, and repairing existing infrastructure across various provinces.

### Key Metrics
- Completion Rate: 100%
- Population Served: 18.3 million out of a total 28 million
- Total Project Cost: $154.5 million
- Initial Budget: $130.2 million
- Budget Overrun: 18.63%

### Provincial Breakdown
The project targeted several high-need provinces, with Sokoto, Kilimani, and Akatsi receiving the most funding:

### Province	Total Cost
Sokoto	$44.85M
Kilimani	$40.34M
Akatsi	$32.03M

### Improvement Types
The improvements made to enhance water access and quality included:

- Public Taps: Installed in communities with high demand for water access points.
- RO Filters: Added to remove contaminants and improve water quality.
- UV Filters: Installed to reduce biological contamination.
- Infrastructure Repairs: Addressed broken or outdated water infrastructure.
### Improvement Type	Total Cost
- Install Public Taps	$45M
- Install RO Filters	$42M
- Repair Infrastructure	$33M
- Install UV Filters	$23M
### Queue and Usage Insights
Analysis of queue times and usage patterns highlights the following:

- Peak Day: Saturday, with average wait times over 200 minutes.
- Peak Times: Mornings and evenings, indicating high daily water demand during these hours.
These insights can inform future scheduling and resource allocation to reduce wait times and manage demand.

### Crime and Safety Analysis
An additional analysis showed high crime rates, specifically harassment and theft, in areas around water access points. Enhanced security measures, such as improved lighting or community awareness programs, are recommended to protect users and improve community well-being.

### Recommendations
- Budget Planning: Anticipate potential budget overruns in rural and high-need areas to ensure funding for project completion.
- Queue Management: Implement additional water stations or mobile water tankers during peak times to reduce wait times.
- Maintenance and Quality Control: Establish regular maintenance schedules for public taps and filters to ensure continued functionality.
- Enhanced Security: Increase safety measures at high-traffic water points, potentially through lighting and local community engagement.

### Data and Visualizations
This repository includes data files and visualization scripts used to analyze the project's impact and efficiency. Key datasets include:

Project Costs and Population Reach: Breakdown of total cost per province and population served.
Improvement Type and Distribution: Allocation of funds across different types of improvements.
Queue Times and Usage Patterns: Analysis of water usage demand and queue wait times.
Crime Incidents: Safety-related data around water access points.

### Future Work
Further improvements could focus on underserved areas not fully covered in this project, adjusting budget projections for rural infrastructure challenges, and enhancing security protocols at water distribution points.

This repository serves as a reference for the outcomes and insights from the Maji Ndogo Water Project, documenting both achievements and lessons learned. Feedback and contributions are welcome.
