# Maji Ndogo Water Project:
## Data-Driven Strategies for Sustainable Water Access
The Maji Ndogo Water Project is a comprehensive analysis designed to improve water access and infrastructure across various regions in Maji Ndogo. This project was built with the aim of identifying critical areas for intervention, assessing current water access conditions, and developing actionable plans to enhance water distribution and quality. Using interactive data visualizations and in-depth analysis, this project outlines effective strategies to address water scarcity and improve living conditions for the population.

### Key Visualizations:
The dashboard I developed includes visual insights on population served, cost allocation, project completion rates, and wait times by various factors such as day of the week and time of day.

### Key features include:

- Population Impact: Displays total population, number of people served, and improvement percentages by region.
- Cost Breakdown: Allocates costs by province and specific improvements, providing a clear view of budget distribution.
- Time Analysis: Highlights average queue times by day and hour, identifying peak water demand periods to optimize resource allocation.
- Criminal Activity Context: Visualizes prevalent crimes across regions to inform deployment strategies in potentially high-risk areas.
These visual insights empower stakeholders to make data-driven decisions about where and how to allocate resources effectively.

### Insights Gained:
Analysis of the data provided valuable insights into Maji Ndogo's water access landscape:

- Predominantly Rural Water Sources: A large proportion of the population relies on rural water sources, necessitating targeted rural-focused interventions.
- High Dependency on Shared Taps: 43% of residents depend on shared taps, with up to 2000 people per tap, leading to extended queue times, especially on weekends and at peak hours.
- Widespread Infrastructure Failures: 45% of in-home systems are non-functional due to broken infrastructure, affecting water availability in both rural and urban areas.
- Long Queue Times: Average queue times exceed 120 minutes, particularly on Saturdays and at morning/evening peaks, underscoring the need for time-sensitive interventions.
- Clean Water Deficiency in Wells: Only 28% of wells, mostly located in rural provinces, provide clean water, pointing to a critical need for filtration solutions.

### Strategic Action Plan:
Based on the insights, the project recommends a strategic, phased approach for sustainable water improvements:

- Enhance Shared Tap Access: Prioritize repairs and expansion of shared taps to reduce queue times for the largest groups of people.
- Purify Well Water: Implement reverse osmosis (RO) and UV filtration systems for well water in polluted regions.
- Repair Existing Infrastructure: Focus on rehabilitating broken systems to restore functionality, especially in high-density towns like Amina and Zuri.
- Temporary Water Solutions: Dispatch water trucks to communities dependent on rivers while permanent solutions are being implemented.
- Targeted Improvements in Rural Areas: Given the rural concentration of water sources, allocate resources with an understanding of logistical challenges like transportation and labor availability.
This project exemplifies the use of data analytics for social impact, leveraging insights to guide practical and impactful solutions. The dashboard, reports, and strategic recommendations provide a replicable framework for addressing similar infrastructure challenges in other regions.
